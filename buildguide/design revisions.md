I'll try to catalog the small changes to the design here until the shape of the keyboard starts to take shape. I imagine there's going to be a LOT of trial and error, particularly with the trackball.

V .01

the first attempt at getting the keys where I want them. I've 3d printed this layout (and lost the print...) and I like the key locations, but it leaves little to no room for the trackball. The keys may have to move to a less than optimal location to fit the ball. 

V .02

the next step, trying to place the trackball. I really like the track beast's solution but the number of keys available leaves something to be desired, and I've never liked the manuform thumb cluster. Instead of peeling away from the thumb, I'd rather if it cupped, like a Dmote.

v .021

adjusting the number of rows and columns to match a 3x6. not sure if i will stagger the second pinkey row or not. maybe. might be fine where it is. 

V .03?

I am considering removing the top row of keys. I will have a numberpad layer, so they are probably unnessisary. I definitely need some extra side keys though, so that I can have a place for modifiers.
