This is my current projected parts list. I'm still REALLY early in the process, so this is subject to change. A lot

- Gateron Browns x56 (holy shit, I thought there were more) I bought 47 and added them to the leftovers from my ergodox build. could have saved money if I'd realised i didnt need that many. $14.90
- Esp-32s x2. I'm using a set of SUPER cheap ones off amazon. 5ct for 25.99
- 34mm trackball. i feel like i'm going to end up changing this one to the size used by the Oddball, but i wanted a real trackball and not a cheap cueball prop. $10
- PMW3360 Motion Sensor from tindie. $29
- 1/8" ball bearings. I picked up steel ball bearings, which may be a bad idea. Here's hoping I dont rub flat spots on my trackball. 5.45
- a set of keycaps. I have a 'wrong' set from my ergodox build, and can use those, but I am sorely tempted to 3d print my own caps. either way cost negligable. 
- filament for the casing. I can easily get a few practice cases out of a roll, so $15. 
- 22ga solid core copper wire.  I cant stand stranded core, it doesnt solder right. $6.98 for 25'. hope that's enough. It should be.
- 1n4148 switching diode. funny thing here, I bought 100 for my ergodox, they sent me 300... (100ct $4.99)
- 3mm threaded inserts. also from the ergodox build. (100ct $1.44)
- m3 6mm screws, left over from the ergodox. Starting to see why I bought bulk. or maybe why I thought a second keyboard was a tempting idea... (100ct $6.47)

running total: 106.42
total with 'free' ergodox parts:119.32

missing parts?:
- I'm unsure if i'll need a lens for the trackball sensor. need to look into that.
- paint?
- connector jacks
- wire for connector jacks
- usb cable
- usb connector jack?
- a truckload of patience
- mouse wheel encoders
