This is my current projected parts list. I'm still REALLY early in the process, so this is subject to change. A lot

- Gateron Browns x45 (holy shit, I thought there were more) I bought 47 and added them to the leftovers from my ergodox build. could have saved money if I'd realised i less than half that. (47ct $14.90)
- pro micro atmega32u4. i lost them. then purchased below. that's right, three different boards bought for this build.... (2ct 10.99)
- Esp-32s x2. I'm using a set of SUPER cheap ones off amazon. (5ct 25.99) 
      ((unused. turns out esp32's cant talk via usb, which means they're only useful in a keyboard as a blutooth. wish i'd gotten esp32 s2's...) 
- raspberry pi pico 2x. replaced above. (4)
- 34mm trackball. i feel like i'm going to end up changing this one to the size used by the Oddball, but i wanted a real trackball and not a cheap cueball prop. ($10)
- PMW3360 Motion Sensor from tindie. ($29)
- 1/8" ball bearings. I picked up steel ball bearings, which may be a bad idea. Here's hoping I dont rub flat spots on my trackball. (100ct 5.45)
- a set of keycaps. 3d printed some DES profile caps on my voxelal proxima. 
- filament for the casing. I can easily get a few practice cases out of a roll, so $15. 
- 22ga solid core copper wire.  I cant stand stranded core, it doesnt solder right.(25f 6.98)
- 1n4148 switching diode. funny thing here, I bought 100 for my ergodox, they sent me 300... (100ct $4.99)
- 3mm threaded inserts. also from the ergodox build. (100ct $1.44)
- m3 6mm screws, left over from the ergodox. Starting to see why I bought bulk. or maybe why I thought a second keyboard was a tempting idea... (100ct $6.47)
- flashtree trrs breakout boards. not sure if these are still available. (3ct 5.99)
- 9mm mouse encoder. bought a bunch to use in another project. (25ct 9.25)


i really hadnt planned on adding LED's but the keycaps i printed off are translucent and it was just begging for it. time for more unnessisary purchases!
- 20ma 2v 3mm yellow LED's. should have paid attention. bought 2v's instead of the 1.8v i planed for. ugh. also accidentally purched flat top leds instead of the square ones i'd wanted. ALSO ended up only using 8 of these.... (100ct 6.98) 
- 300 ohm 1/4w resistors. bought these for the LED's above, miscalculated. i was shooting for 5ma ea, but ended up with 4.5ma because of a derp (100ct 5.00)
- 2ma 1.7v 3mm red LED's. bought these because i misunderstood how current works with resistors and was sure that i wouldnt be able to power anything bigger. turns out i'm a dumb wizard and i could have used any ol' led with the right resistor and had enough juice. as it is, however, these puppies save me quite a bit of juice and they're much brighter than the yellows by comparison (just running off a pair of AAA's) so the MUCH higher cost is still kinda worth it imo. (100ct 20.49)
- 820 ohm 1/4w resistors. for the led's above.  (100ct, 5.00)

running total: 131.40

total with 'free' ergodox parts:144.30

total with LED's on top: 181.77

total with 'free' parts without stupid purchases: 115ish

missing parts?:
- usb cable
- usb connector jack?
- a truckload of patience
