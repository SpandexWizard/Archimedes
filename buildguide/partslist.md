This is my current projected parts list. I'm still REALLY early in the process, so this is subject to change. A lot

- Gateron Browns x45 (holy shit, I thought there were more) I bought 47 and added them to the leftovers from my ergodox build. could have saved money if I'd realised i less than half that. $14.90
- Esp-32s x2. I'm using a set of SUPER cheap ones off amazon. 5ct for 25.99 ((unused. turns out esp32's cant talk via usb, which means they're only useful in a keyboard as a blutooth. wish i'd gotten esp32 s2's...)
- raspberry pi pico x2. replaced above. 4 bucks a pop plus shipping.
- 34mm trackball. i feel like i'm going to end up changing this one to the size used by the Oddball, but i wanted a real trackball and not a cheap cueball prop. $10
- PMW3360 Motion Sensor from tindie. $29
- 1/8" ball bearings. I picked up steel ball bearings, which may be a bad idea. Here's hoping I dont rub flat spots on my trackball. 5.45
- a set of keycaps. I have a 'wrong' set from my ergodox build, and can use those, but I am sorely tempted to 3d print my own caps. either way cost negligable. 
- filament for the casing. I can easily get a few practice cases out of a roll, so $15. 
- 22ga solid core copper wire.  I cant stand stranded core, it doesnt solder right. $6.98 for 25'. hope that's enough. It should be.
- 1n4148 switching diode. funny thing here, I bought 100 for my ergodox, they sent me 300... (100ct $4.99)
- 3mm threaded inserts. also from the ergodox build. (100ct $1.44)
- m3 6mm screws, left over from the ergodox. Starting to see why I bought bulk. or maybe why I thought a second keyboard was a tempting idea... (100ct $6.47)

i really hadnt planned on adding LED's but the keycaps i printed off are translucent and it was just begging for it. time for more unnessisary purchases!
- 20ma 2v 3mm yellow LED's (100ct 6.98) should have paid attention. bought 2v's instead of the 1.8v i planed for. ugh. also accidentally purched flat top leds instead of the square ones i'd wanted. ALSO ended up only using 8 of these.... 
- 300 ohm 1/4w resistors (100ct 5.00) bought these for the LED's above, miscalculated. i was shooting for 5ma ea, but ended up with 4.5ma because of a derp
- 2ma 1.7v 3mm red LED's (100ct 20.49) bought these because i misunderstood how current works with resistors and was sure that i wouldnt be able to power anything bigger. turns out i'm a dumb wizard and i could have used any ol' led with the right resistor and had enough juice. as it is, however, these puppies save me quite a bit of juice and they're much brighter than the yellows by comparison (just running off a pair of AAA's) so the MUCH higher cost is still kinda worth it imo.
- 820 ohm 1/4w resistors (100ct, 5.00). for the led's above. 

running total: 114.42
total with 'free' ergodox parts:127.32
total with LED's on top: 164.79

missing parts?:
