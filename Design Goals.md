so what makes my baby magic? well nothing yet! but here's my plans
- a tented keyboard that is neither subtle nor steep. something that follows my hand's natural position
- a vertically dished set of keys that limit the amount of reach each finger needs to press a key. 
  -achieved by rotating the keys
- a horizontally DOMED set of keys. It's more comfortable to grab a rounded surface
  -achieved by lifting and lowering columns
- vertically staggered keys that consider finger length. 
- a trackball. this wasnt super important to me, but soemthing I've always considered interesting. And my mice keep breaking.If i'm going to go all in, I might as well REALLY go all in
- a scrollwheel, to go with that trackball.
